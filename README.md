# 🎯 Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation

This repository contains all relevant files and documentation related to the phishing simulation project conducted as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship at Future Intern**. The task involved safely simulating phishing attacks using open-source tools to understand user behavior and improve security awareness.

---

## 🧪 Task Objective
Simulate phishing campaigns to test user awareness using realistic email templates and landing pages, and track engagement metrics to derive insights.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **GoPhish** – To build and manage phishing campaigns
- **Mailtrap** – Safe sandbox SMTP server to test email delivery
- **CSV** – User list for email targeting
- **HTML** – For phishing email and fake login page
- **Windows 11**, Chrome

## 📁 Contents

- `reports/` – Contains the final report on phishing simulation
- `templates/` – Email and landing page HTML files
- `users/` – CSV file with dummy user list
- `screenshots/` – Visual evidence of the simulation
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation

---

## 📊 Outcome
The simulation helped visualize how phishing attacks are crafted and delivered. It included open tracking, credential harvesting, and full campaign analysis.
